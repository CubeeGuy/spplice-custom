# The first ever dedicated Portal 2 mod launcher
The Simple Portal 2 Package Loading Instrument for Convenient External modding, or Spplice for short, aims to be a solution to intuitive and user-friendly Portal 2 modding. Spplice makes it easy for players to hop in and play, and lets developers focus less on distribution, and more on making their games fun.

### Built on NeutralinoJS
To keep things lightweight, this project uses [NeutralinoJS](https://neutralino.js.org) for the web-based UI and for the API that manages Steam, Portal 2 and all of the packages. In short, Neutralino is similar to Electron. But instead of bundling a whole browser, it relies on what's already present on the user's system.

### Custom directories
This version of Spplice has the ability to use custom Portal 2 installations. **We do not support piracy**. This version is intended to be used for educational purposes only.

### Contributing
To contribute, all you need is Git, Neutralino, Steam, Portal 2, and a general understanding of what Spplice is about.

Assuming you've already installed Neutralino on your system, clone the repository and do `neu update` to fetch the required binaries. Then you can do `neu run` to ensure that everything works properly.
